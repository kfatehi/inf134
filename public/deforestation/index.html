        <p>Our world is home to beautful forests that cover 31% of Earth's land surface.</p>
        
        <p>Not only are they home to 80 percent of the world's terrestrial biodiversity, but they are a major source of oxygen in the atmosphere.</p>

        <p>300 million people call forests home and 1.6 billion depend on them to survive.</p>

        <p>Forests also serve as places for recreational activity.</p>

        <p>Do you like going camping, hiking, or biking in fresh air?</p>

        <p>Well you are not alone. Millions of other people travel from different parts of the world to escape to the forests to de-stress.</p>

        <p>Over the past 40 years, the rate of deforestation has significantly increased to satisfy the needs of the people.</p>

        <p>Land is needed for cropland and infrastructures.</p>

        <p>Wood is needed for fuel and paper.</p>

        <p>But, when deforestations occurs, the effects lead to serious consequences.</p>

        <p>When the slash and burn technique is used to clear land for agricultural reasons, massive amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere, contributing to <a href="">Climate Change</a>.</p>

        <p>Animals are homeless.</p>

        <p>They are left with limited resources and no place to go.</p>

        <p>With no accessible food or shelter, they have the risk of becoming endangered or even <a href="">extinct.</a></p>

        <p>Our world needs forests to absorb greenhouse gases, provide resources and shelter for millions of people and animals, and help sustain the water cycle that is a major component of any ecosystem, to name a few. </p>
        <p>There are many organizations that want to fight deforestation and educate people about the serious repercussions associated with it.</p>
