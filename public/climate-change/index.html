            <p>Have you noticed that summers are hotter and winters are warmer?</p> 
            <p>Do you ever see breaking news about an extreme weather event that threatens the places people call home?</p> 
            <p>Well, these events are happening because of the rapid climate change occurring on Earth. </p>

            <p>People sometimes ask, “What’s the difference between global warming and climate change?” </p>
            <p>Well, <span id="gw">global warming</span> refers to the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases while <span id="cc">climate change</span> refers to the broader set of changes that go along with global warming, including changes in weather patterns, the oceans, ice and snow, and ecosystems.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">NASA</a>, "97 percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities."</p>
            <p>We rely on fossil fuels to power our cars, give us light in the dark, and produce goods that we use on a daily basis, just to name a few.</p>
            <p>We have grown accustom to using large amounts of fossil fuels to help us get through daily activities, but we sometimes overlook the long-term effects it has on us and our environment.</p>

            <p>The effects of climate change include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rising sea levels and temperatures</li>
                <li>Changes in preciptation patterns</li>
                <li>Stronger and more intense hurricanes</li>
                <li>More droughts and heat waves</li>

            <p>Why do these matter to you?</p>
            <p>Well, 40% of the world's population lives within 100 kilometers of the coast.</p>
