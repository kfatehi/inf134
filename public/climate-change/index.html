        <p>Have you noticed that summers are hotter and winters are warmer?</p> 
        <p>Do you ever see breaking news about an extreme weather event that threatens the places people call home?</p> 
        <p>Well, these events happen because of the rapid climate change occurring on Earth. </p>

        <p>People sometimes ask, “What’s the difference between global warming and climate change?” </p>
        <p>Well, global warming refers to the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases while climate change refers to the broader set of changes that go along with global warming, including changes in weather patterns, the oceans, ice and snow, and ecosystems.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">NASA</a>, "97 percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities."</p>

        <p>We rely on fossil fuels to power our cars, give us light in the dark, and produce goods that we use on a daily basis, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>We have grown accustom to using large amounts of fossil fuels to help us get through daily activities, but we sometimes overlook the effects it has on our environment.</p>
