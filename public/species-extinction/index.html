			<p>While extinction is considered a natural phenomenon that occurs in the background, Our planet is experiencing a huge wave of extinction in both plants and animals.</p>
			<p>In our current state, scientist are estimating that we are now losing about 1,000 to 10,000 times the normal rate of extinction.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="page3">
			
			<p>Most of the past waves of extinctions were caused by events such as volcanic eruptions, asteroid strikes or natural climate shifts.</p>
			<p>However, the current crisis is considered to be caused by none other than us, humans.</p>
			<p>The introduction of developing socities created more human activies which in turn introduced more exotic species but also drove animals out of their normal habitats as well as created the <a href="../climate-change/index.html">global warming crisis.</a></p>

		<div id="page4">
			<p>There may not be clear estimate as to how many species are in actual danger of becoming extinct.</p>
			<p>It is very clear how big of an issue species extinction really is as well as the increasing numbers of species that are at risk of possibly disappearing forever.</p>
